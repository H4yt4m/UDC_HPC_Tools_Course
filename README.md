# HPC Tools Tasks
This repository contains my project for the HPC Tools Course, during my M.Sc. degree at the University of A Coruña in Spain.

The purpose of this code is to compute the solution to a system of linear equations, written in the matrix form as : AX=B. 

To archieve this goal, the dgesv routine is an implementation of the LU decomposition of a system of linear equations method. The final task is to enhance its efficiency using various optimization techniques.

🚩 : Some of my projects intentionally remain without updates to serve as a record of my ongoing development and learning journey. 😁
